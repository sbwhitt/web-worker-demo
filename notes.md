WebWorkers allow the browser to run scripts in a background thread. This allows long-running (synchronous) operations to complete in the background without blocking the main thread and locking up UI elements. 

WebWorkers communicate with the main thread through messaging. Workers can receive messages from the main thread and post messages to be handled by the main thread.

Create a worker by initializing it with a URL to a JS script. Worker is created with it's own execution context and has no access to anything outside of that. All dependencies must be contained within the provided script; cannot import from outside of the new execution context. Worker also has no access to DOM elements or the window object. 

Angular CLI can generate web worker templates to be used by Angular apps. Default worker template provides a message handler that receives a data input to be processed by the worker. Could be a function argument, file, large object, etc. or empty simply to kick off the worker process. Within the Angular worker.ts file, imports can be used since all of the worker dependencies will be bundled into a contained script after building. 

Worker is initialized by passing the path to the worker.ts file as well as the meta url: `import.meta.url`. This keeps track of the file path after project has been bundled. 

Before posting the initial message to kick off the worker, must define an onmessage handler that processes any messages posted from the worker while it is running. Can additionally define onerror handlers to process errors that occur within the worker. 

Start worker by calling `worker.postMessage(data)`. Worker receives message and runs based on the message data that was passed. Any outputs passed from the worker to the main thread must be copied since they are running in different contexts. Worker can output any JSON like object through postMessage, but not function/class objects. 

Call `worker.terminate` to shut down worker thread and cancel any operations. 

Worker scripts can be debugged like normal source code within browser developer tools. 

WebWorkers are widely supported by major browsers, but should provide backup code to run without workers if not available.
